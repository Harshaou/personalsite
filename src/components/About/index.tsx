                I'm Harshad. I'm a React, Javascript enthusiast. Working as a Front-end Engineer at Webdura technologies.
                React ecosystem is growing so rapidly, 
                which I'm so excited about. Tools like Gatsby and Next is enabling new kind of web. From the development experience to great performance,
                good SEO, rich and delightful user experience. It's never been a better time to be a front end developer. I'm looking to be a part of team that
